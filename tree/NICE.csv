"Do you know which Tier of Digital Healthcare Technology (DHT), simply put, your software belongs to according to NICE rules?",13 lines down,1 line down,,class III
"Ok. Let's start functional classification now. Can your Digital Healthcare Technology (DHT) be directly downloaded or purchased by users? Or, is your Digital Healtcare Technology (DHT) designed with artificial intelligence using adaptive algorithms (that is, algorithms which continually and automatically change)? ",13 lines down,1 line down,,downloaded or purchased
"Now, let's start figuring out which Tier your DHT belongs to. Please remember your latest Tier as I say. Is your DHT unlikely to have direct and measurable individual patient outcomes? (If yes, Tier 1 - system service)",1 line down,1 line down,,1-System service
"Does your DHT provides information and resources to patients or the public? The information can include specific conditions or about healty living. (If yes, Tier 2 - inform)",1 line down,1 line down,,2-Inform
"Does your DHT allow users to record health parameters to create health diaries that are NOT shared with or sent to others? (If yes, Tier 2 - simple monitoring)",1 line down,1 line down,,2-Simple monitoring
"Does your DHT allow 2-way communication between users and professionals, 3rd party organisations or peers? (Clinical advice is provided by professionals using the DHT). (If yes, Tier 2 - communicate)",1 line down,1 line down,,2-Communicate
"Is your DHT designed to change user behaviour related to health issues (eg. smoking, eating, alcohol, sexual health, sleeping and exercise.)? (If yes, Tier 3a - preventative behaviour change)",1 line down,1 line down,,3a-behaviour change
"Does your DHT aim to help people with a diagnosed condition to manage their health? This may include symptom tracking function that connects with a healthcare professional. (If yes, Tier 3a - self-manage)",1 line down,1 line down,,3a-self_manage
"Does your DHT provide treatment for a diagnosed condition, such as CBT for anxiety, or guides treatment decisions? (If yes, Tier 3b - treat)",1 line down,1 line down,,3b-treat
"Does your DHT automatically records information and transmits the data to a professional, career or 3rd party organisation WITHOUT any input from the user, to inform clinical management decisions? (If yes, Tier 3b - active monitoring)",1 line down,1 line down,,3b-acitve_monitoring
"Does your DHT have tools that perform clinical calculations that are likely to affect clinical care decisions? (If yes, Tier 3b - calculate)",1 line down,1 line down,,3b-calculate
"Does your DHT use data to diagnose a condition in a patient, or to guide a diagnostic decision made by a healthcare professional? (If yes, Tier 3b - diagnose)",1 line down,1 line down,,3b-Diagnose
"This is the end of the Functional Classification. If you have told multiple Tiers, then you have to choose the highest Tier. Plus, the Tiers are cumulative. This means that your DHT must meet all the standards in the previous Tier(s), as well as its own Tier. (Please say Clarification if you need more explanation)",,,"For Example, a DHT in Tier3a must meet the standard for Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3a; DHT in Tier 3b must meet the standards for all Tiers",Functional Classification Over
Great! You’re all set!,,,,already knows NICE class
"I am sorry. NICE's framework has been designed for DHTs that are commissioned in the UK health and care system, it is less relevant to DHTs that are downloaded or purchased directly by users (such as through app stores). Separate standards (including principle 7 of the code of conduct for data-driven health and care technology) will apply to your DHT. Do you want me to move on to the NHSD checking? Plus, NICE's framework may be used with DHTs that incorporate artificial intelligence using fixed algorithms. However, it is not designed for use with DHTs that incorporate artificial intelligence using adaptive algorithms. For the same reason, separate standards (including principle 7 of the code of conduct for data-driven health and care technology) will apply to your DHT.",,,,sorry
